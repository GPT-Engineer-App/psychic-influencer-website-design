# psychic-influencer-website-design

I need assistance in crafting a website design for psychic influencer Kendall Haught. The primary focus is on membership sign-up, offering exclusive content and services through tiered subscriptions.

Homepage Layout:

Design a visually captivating hero section introducing Kendall and the website's purpose. Include a clear call to action prompting users to explore membership options.
Implement a vertical carousel showcasing the three membership tiers, each containing a description of its benefits, price, and a call to action button.
Integrate a dropdown menu at the top, providing access to essential pages like Contact, About Kendall, Membership Information, and a secure Sign Up page.
Sign Up Page:

On the Sign Up page, allow users to select their desired membership tier, create an account with email and password, and securely provide credit/debit card information for payment processing.
Additional Requirements:

Maintain a consistent and visually appealing design aligned with Kendall's brand identity.
